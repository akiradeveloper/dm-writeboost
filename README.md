Log-structured Caching for Linux

## Overview
dm-writeboost is originated from [Disk Caching Disk (DCD)](http://www.ele.uri.edu/research/hpcl/DCD/DCD.html).
DCD, implemented in Solaris, is an OS-level IO controller that builds logs from in-coming writes
(data and metadata) and then writes the logs sequentially similar to log-structured filesystem.
dm-writeboost implements the concept on Linux's device-mapper in more sophisticated way.
As a further extension, dm-writeboost supports read-caching which also writes data sequentially.

## Features
* **Durable**: Any power failure can't break consistency because each log consists of data, metadata and
  the checksum of the log itself.  
* **Lifetime**: Other caching software (e.g. dm-cache) separates data and
  metadata and therefore submits writes to SSD too frequently. dm-writeboost,
  on the other hand, submits only one  writes for hundreds of data and
  metadata updates so the SSD lives longer since SSD's lifetime depends on
  how many writes are submitted.  
* **Fast**: Since the sequential write is the best I/O pattern for every SSD and the code base is optimized for
  in-coming random writes, the write performance is the best among all caching drivers including dm-cache and
  bcache.  
* **Portable**: All kernel version 3.10 or later is supported with minimum compile-time macros.

## Usage
- **Install**: `sudo make install` to install and `sudo make uninstall` to uninstall.
  `sudo make uninstall MODULE_VERSION=xxx` can uninstall specific version that's installed.
  DKMS is required so please install it beforehand. (usually available in package system)
- **Make a device**: Make a script to build a caching device. Please read doc/dm-writeboost-readme.txt for
  the dmsetup command detail.
  After reboot, you need to rebuild the caching device rather than reformatting as in the initial setup.
